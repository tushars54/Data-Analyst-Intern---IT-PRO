MVC Store in Jalandhar wants to create an annual report for 202, so that it can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2023 . 

I created this Data analysis project in excel. 
Steps involed :- 
1. Data Cleaning 
	Data types were checked
	Any columns containing null values 
	Duplicate values

2. Data processing
   New columns were created that were useful for analysis
	Age Group - IF formula was used
	Month - Extracted only month from date using TEXT formula

3. Data Analysis
	Created different Pivot table and corresponding charts for analysis
	Created combo chart " Order vs Sales " 
		This helped us to check which month record highest sales and no. of orders in each month.
